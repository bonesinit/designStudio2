This is the basic folders that can be setup to work on the Environment.
Please refer to Production Project Pipeline notes found on CuLearn and Google Drive.  

When you submit the File do not keep any textfiles that have been provided to your for pedagogical purposes.

For simplicity, I would suggest you may not want to Reference Lights.  
Have the Environment file have the lights in it rather than referencing them in.

However if you wish to work this way, you may create a light folder.

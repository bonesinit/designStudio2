As with the Props Directory.
These contain the final version of a texture that will be reference by the prop.
Note, when you are working at home, you should keep the same file structure.
When the prop is checked in it will be looking for the texture file.  If the file is in a different location, Maya may not be able to find it when it builds the final referenced file.
